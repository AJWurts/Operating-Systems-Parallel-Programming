# Operating-Systems-Parallel-Programming

A program designed to implment parallel processing by simulating a bathroom.  
There is one bathroom for any number of guys and girls, but only one gender can be in the bathroom at a time.  
Guys and girls come at random times, need to queue them and them process them without any overlap.  
Needs to simulate this without any deadlocks.
